# PharosDotMoney

The First RWA-Covered Stablecoin Engine

## Overview

PharosDotMoney is redefining what it means to hold a stablecoin. In a space cluttered with unstable models and risky DeFi loops, Pharos offers a stablecoin backed by productive real-world activity — not inflated token emissions or unsustainable mechanics. At its core, Pharos mints stablecoins that are fully backed, yield-bearing, and secured by a decentralized network of Real World Asset (RWA) operators. This is the future of stable value — scalable, safe, and censorship-resistant.

## Key Features

### 🔐 Non-Custodial Design
- Your assets remain in your control
- No centralized custody or opaque rehypothecation

### 🌍 Real-World Yield Generation

### 🛡 Fully Covered Risk Model
- Shared security model ensures protection
- Agent activity is underwritten
- Bad behavior is slashed
- Self-regulating, trustless protection layer

### 💵 Flexible Stablecoin Options
